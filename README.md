# pychess

Some chess experiments using the python chess library.

Written for absolutely no reason but boredom.

# Contents

- lbchess-pieces : Try to place N pieces of a given Symbol on the board which do not attack each other. Used to solve the eight queens problem using backtracking
- lbchess-randomgame : See two players playing a completely random game.

`lbchess.engine` is still in development and has no executable yet. Check tests for usage examples but do not expect it to be smart, fast or in any other way useful.

# Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```
